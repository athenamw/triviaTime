# triviaTime

## Description
Create a multiple choice quiz with at least 4 answers to choose from. Create a timer that deducts time when a wrong answer is chosen. Create a link to a saved highscore database. Create an input area that allows the player to see their score and enter their initials to be saved to the leaderboard.

## Usage
This is a quiz that is meant to be fun and test javascript knowledge. It is also meant to display skills that were learned during bootcamp.

## Credits
I had help from my tutor Dru Sanchez to understand loops. I used AskBCS about JSON. The other resources I used were Google. I reused my reset CSS page for this project.
